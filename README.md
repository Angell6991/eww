## Description 

This repository is an application of Elkowars Wacky Widgets (EWW) on the Hyprland window manager, 
where the desktop features a series of widgets that allow opening applications such as a calendar, 
a clock application, and a power menu, all built with EWW as well.

If you wish to copy the same configuration shown in the demonstration, the applications displayed are:    
    
- gnome-calendar
- gnome-clocks
- blueman-manager

And the necessary fonts are: 

- [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
- [warhammer40k](https://github.com/Angell6991/Instalation_programs/tree/master/Fonts)
- [Digital Dismay](https://www.dafont.com/digital-dismay.font)

Although these applications and fonts can be replaced with others of your choice, it will require some digging into the code.
